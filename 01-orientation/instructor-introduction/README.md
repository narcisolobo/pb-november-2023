# Welcome to Programming Basics and Coding Dojo!

![Seeso and Jinja](assets/jinja.jpg)

I'm Narciso Lobo, your instructor for this course. I've been with the Dojo for just over three years.

I've been coding off and on for over twenty years. I first started in 2000, and worked in the advertising industry as a front-end developer.

Afterwards, I concentrated on acting, music, and teaching the same while also creating websites freelance. Before coming to the Dojo, I worked in the construction industry for almost ten years.

In 2016, I was diagnosed with colon cancer. After recovering, I decided to change careers. My heart wasn't in construction and I didn't want to spend another gifted day pursuing something I didn't love.

In 2018, I came to the Dojo. I learned onsite at the Chicago campus. I had no knowledge about back-end programming, and my front-end skills needed polishing. They couldn't get rid of me. I devoured everything they threw at me and then some.

In 2020, I became a full-time instructor. I'm living proof that the Coding Dojo can change lives.
