# Intro to JavaScript Variables

## Imagine a Box:

A variable is like a box in which you can store things. This box has a name (the variable name or *identifier*) and can hold different items (values).

- Giving Names to Things: Let's say you have a box labeled "toys." You put different toys in this box. Similarly, in programming, a variable is like a box where you store different types of information, and you give that box a name.

- Storage: Just as you put toys, books, or clothes in different boxes, in programming, you can put numbers, words, or other information in a variable.

- Easy Access: The name on the box helps you know what's inside. Similarly, the name of the variable helps you and the computer remember what's stored there.

- Changing Content: You can change what's inside the box. Today it might have toy cars, but tomorrow you could replace them with action figures. In programming, you can change the information stored in a variable as needed.

For example:

```js
var numberOfToys = 5;
```
Here, `numberOfToys` is the name of the box, and `5` is what's stored inside. It could be the number of toys you have. Later, you could change it to `10` if you get more toys:

```js
numberOfToys = 10;
```

This way, the variable `numberOfToys` now stores a different value.

## Purpose of Variables:

Variables help us remember and work with information in a program. They are like containers that hold different kinds of information, making it easy for us to keep track of and manipulate that information.

They're used to store numbers, words, results of calculations, and many other things that a program needs to remember and use. Just like labels on your boxes help you find what you need, variable names help the computer find and use the information it needs to do tasks.

Variables are a fundamental building block in programming, allowing us to manage and manipulate data, making our programs smart and adaptable.
