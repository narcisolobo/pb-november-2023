# Introduction to JavaScript
JavaScript was written in ten days in the year 1995 by Brendan Eich. It was written in order to make websites more interactive and dynamic. Today, it is the most commonly-used programming language in the world.

## Event-Driven Language
JavaScript is an event-driven language, which means that the execution of code in JavaScript is largely based on events and event handlers.

In an event-driven environment like JavaScript:

1. Events: These are actions or occurrences that happen in the system or in a webpage (e.g., a button click, page load, mouse movement, keypress).

2. Event Handlers: These are functions (pieces of code) that are executed or triggered in response to specific events. They're associated with the event and define what should happen when that event occurs.

In JavaScript, event-driven programming is commonly used in web development, where the browser interacts with users through various events. For instance:

- Button Click: When a user clicks a button on a webpage, an event (the click event) is triggered.
- Input Events: Typing into a form field triggers events like 'keypress' or 'input'.
- Page Load: When a web page finishes loading, a 'load' event occurs.

JavaScript allows developers to define functions (event handlers) that should be executed when these events occur. These event handlers are assigned to specific elements or parts of the webpage. When the event occurs, the associated function is executed.

We won't be exploring event-driven programming until Web Fundamentals.
